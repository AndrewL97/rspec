Hidden files are created automatically by many tools to save user-preferences, well-known examples are `+.profile+`, `+.bashrc+`, `+.bash_history+` or .`+git+`. To simplify the view these files are not displayed by default using operating system commands like `+ls+`.

Outside of the user environment, hidden files are sensitive because they are used to store privacy-related information or even hard-coded secrets.
