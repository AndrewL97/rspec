The goal of this rule is to track the use of cookies. Security auditors can then decide which cookies need attention.

As a Security auditor, I must said : "you should never store any sensitive information in a cookie".

Having the https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/bugs.htm#COOKIE_USAGE[FindSecBugs rule COOKIE_USAGE] in the description is a bit misleading. The description of the rule is ok, but the actual find-sec-bugs implementation is inside https://github.com/find-sec-bugs/find-sec-bugs/blob/1d288ef15122a4d883343769dd221cbe7bbeecb1/plugin/src/main/java/com/h3xstream/findsecbugs/cookie/CookieReadDetector.java[CookieReadDetector.java] which merely detects if the cookie is read.

Deprecated because it overlaps with rules related to cookies (flags etc)

The content of a cookies is often sensitive (session id, tracking id), it's their goal, there is nothing to fix when an issue is raised here.
