Note that this rule is a bit more generic for dynamically typed languages. In Java calling ``++assertThat(x).isInstanceOf(x)++`` is likely to fail because ``++isInstanceOf++`` wants a ``++Class++`` as parameter. For languages like PHP or Javascript it is possible to make such a typo. If the test is skipped the issue will go undetected.
