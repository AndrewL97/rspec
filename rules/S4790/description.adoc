Cryptographic hash algorithms such as `+MD2+`, `+MD4+`, `+MD5+`, `+MD6+`, `+HAVAL-128+`, `+HMAC-MD5+`, `+DSA+` (which uses `+SHA-1+`), `+RIPEMD+`, `+RIPEMD-128+`, `+RIPEMD-160+`, `+HMACRIPEMD160+` and `+SHA-1+` are no longer considered secure, because it is too easy to create hash collisions with them (little computational effort is enough to find two or more different inputs that produces the same hash).
