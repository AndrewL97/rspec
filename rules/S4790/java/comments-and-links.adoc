The goal is to highlight code that initiates a hashing process. The Hash functions can be used by many different classes and it would be too complicated to list them all. Thus we detect the requests for hashing functions themselves, or the shortcut functions which hash without asking for a hash function (ex: ``++org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.sha1(data)++``).
