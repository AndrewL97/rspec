== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Safer alternatives, such as ``++SHA-256++``, ``++SHA-512++``, ``++SHA-3++`` or ``++bcrypt++`` are recommended, and for password hashing, it's even better to use algorithms that not compute too "quickly", like ``++bcrypt++`` instead of ``++SHA-256++``, because it slows brute force and dictionary based attacks.
