== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Safer alternatives, such as ``++SHA-256++``, ``++SHA-512++``, ``++SHA-3++`` are recommended, and for password hashing, it's even better to use algorithms that do not compute too "quickly", like ``++bcrypt++``, ``++scrypt++``, ``++argon2++`` or ``++pbkdf2++`` because it slows down ``++brute force attacks++``.
