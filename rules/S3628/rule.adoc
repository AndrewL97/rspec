Since C++11, raw string literals can be used to avoid the need to escape characters in a string. Such character string literals are easier to read.

This rule raises an issue when a non-raw string contains one of the following escaped characters: ``&#92;'`` ``&#92;&#92;`` ``&#92;"`` ``&#92;?``.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
const char* Path = "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office16\\";  // Noncompliant, contains \\
const char* RegEx = "\\\\(\\\\.\\\\)"; // Noncompliant, contains \\
const char* QuestionMark = "a\?b"; // Noncompliant, contains \?
const char* TwoLines = "one\r\ntwo"; // Compliant, contains \r \n
const char* OneChar = "\\"; // Compliant, only one character
----


== Compliant Solution

----
const char* Path = R"(C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\)";
const char* RegEx = R"(\(\.\))";
const char* QuestionMark = R"(a?b)";
const char* TwoLines = "one\r\ntwo";
const char* OneChar = "\\";
----


== Exceptions

To preserve readability, this rule ignores strings containing only one character and strings with escaped whitespace or non-printable characters:

* Non-printable characters: ``\a`` ``\b`` ``\f`` ``\v`` ``\nnn`` ``\xnn`` ``\unnnn`` ``\Unnnnnnnn``
* Tab: ``\t``
* New line: ``\r`` ``\n``
