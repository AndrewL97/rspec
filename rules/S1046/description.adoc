The catch-all handler should come last in a chain of `+catch+` or `+@catch+` statements because it catches everything, and any more-specific `+catch+`/`+@catch+` that comes after it will never be used, even when the relevant condition occurs. 

This C++ code sample is very similar to the Objective-C equivalent with `+@try+` and `+@catch+`.
