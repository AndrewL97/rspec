The catch-all handler should come last in a chain of ``++catch++`` or ``++@catch++`` statements because it catches everything, and any more-specific ``++catch++``/``++@catch++`` that comes after it will never be used, even when the relevant condition occurs. 

This {cpp} code sample is very similar to the Objective-C equivalent with ``++@try++`` and ``++@catch++``.
