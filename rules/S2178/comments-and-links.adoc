Is the different quotes (single and double) in the message intended ?

The example is not so clear with the printed/not printed message : if I assume that getTrue() returns true, message will be printed in both cases. What changes is that the getFalse() method is executed (and therefore it is where there should be a System.out.println )

re the message, typically I try to (remember to) distinguish between a char ('') and a string (""), although the distinction was not appropriate in this context, even though it went from one keystroke to two. :-)


re the example, yes, I had messed that up. Simplified it & now it's at least not wrong, although not as exhaustive as the one you gave me.

Irrelevant for:

TypeScript, error: The '|' operator is not allowed for boolean types. Consider using '||' instead.

Swift, error: binary operator '|' cannot be applied to two 'Bool' operands.

ABAP, C, JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, PL/I, RPG: There's no boolean type.

Python: Likelihood of confusion is low, operators are ``++or++`` and ``++|++``
