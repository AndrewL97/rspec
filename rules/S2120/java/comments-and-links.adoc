Scope of the rule is really important here:

We don't have interprocedural analysis so, we can't actually analyze what is the implementation of a remote method call. 


So what's left : implementation of call to methods declared within the same class, but then you would raise issue exactly because you are calling a method that is supposed to be overidden in inherited classes.


So I don't see how we can actually deal with this rule.
