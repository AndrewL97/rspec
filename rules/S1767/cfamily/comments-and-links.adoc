\[~ann.campbell.2] how this relates to RSPEC-857 ?

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] are you really asking how, or just pointing out that there is a relationship?  


No idea why I created a new rspec ticket when one already existed. Presumably I simply didn't notice the first one. But since this newer one is fully-fleshed think we should close the other one. Objections?

Provided solution is not compliant, because "long" might be not large enough to hold pointer at least because there is "long long" type. See description in MISRA C:2012 11.4, which shows proper solution for C99 - usage of type "intptr_t", and thus there is also proper solution for {cpp} - usage of "std::intptr_t".


All MISRA descriptions are about "integral types", which is not the same as "int" used in both title and description - quoting CPP11 (ISO/IEC 14882:2011) 3.9.1p7:

____
Types bool, char, char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t, and the signed and unsigned integer types are collectively called integral types.

Actually [~evgeny.mandrikov] the descriptions all talk about "integer type", but point taken & corrections made.

A synonym for integral type is integer type.
