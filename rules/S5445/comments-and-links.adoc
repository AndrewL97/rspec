PHP offers two built-in function to create temporary files:

* \https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.tmpfile.php
* \https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.tempnam.php
Both function create a file with a unique filename, with access permission set to 0600. 


This rule doesn't make sens for PHP because built-in functions protect against insecure temporary file.
