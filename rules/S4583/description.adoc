Calling the ``BeginInvoke`` method of a delegate will allocate some resources that are only freed-up when ``EndInvoke`` is called. This is why you should always pair ``BeginInvoke`` with an ``EndInvoke`` to complete your asynchronous call.

This rule raises an issue when:

* the ``BeginInvoke`` method is called without any callback and it is not paired with a call to ``EndInvoke`` in the same block.
* a callback with a single parameter of type ``IAsyncResult`` doesn't contain a call to ``EndInvoke``.
