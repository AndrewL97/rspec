This rule relates to some threads of discussions on the user mailing list:

* It's ultimately hard to know if an object is mutable or not
* And so it's almost impossible to have a rule checking something on "mutable" objects

That's why the scope of the Findbugs rules is limited to known mutable objects like arrays and hashtables. I would also limit the scope of this rule to a defined list of objects.

\[~freddy.mallet] do you want a narrower list than "arrays, collections and Dates" ?
