The purpose of changing the current working directory is to modify the base path when the process performs relative path resolutions. When the working directory cannot be changed, the process keeps the directory previously defined as the active working directory. Thus, verifying the success of chdir() type of functions is important to prevent unintended relative paths and unauthorized access.
