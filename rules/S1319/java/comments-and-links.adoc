I changed LinkedList to List in my project but after 4 levels of changes that I applied successively to return types and parameter types, I encountered list.getLast() and list.removeLast() but those methods do not exist in interface List.


Is it right to use list.get(list.size()-1) instead of list.getLast() in term of performances and complexity ? 


LinkedList keeps references to both head and tail and offers a complexity of O(1), is it the same with list.get(list.size()-1) ?
