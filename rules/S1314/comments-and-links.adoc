About support of octal literals in languages:

Not supported: ABAP, PL/SQL, RPG, T-SQL

Supported without confusion, e.g. decimal value 8 = Cobol(O#10), PL/I('10'B3), Swift (0o10), TypeScript(0o10), VB.Net(&O10), VB6(&O10)

This rule has a low value as python 3 as the syntax is clearly different from decimal numbers (ex: 0o555). It is more difficult to confuse it with a decimal number.
