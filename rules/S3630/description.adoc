Because ``++reinterpret_cast++`` does not perform any type safety validations, it is capable of performing dangerous conversions between unrelated types.


Since {cpp}20, a ``++std::bit_cast++`` should be used instead of ``++reinterpret_cast++`` to reinterpret a value as being of a different type of the same length preserving its binary representation, as the behavior of  ``++reinterpret_cast++`` is undefined in such case.


This rule raises an issue when ``++reinterpret_cast++`` is used.
