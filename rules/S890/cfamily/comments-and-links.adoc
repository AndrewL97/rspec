* "xxx" is modified within the loop body.

In particular, I find "Refactor this modification of the loop counter using a non-constant expression" to sound confusingly like a wrong-headed imperative. I.e. it seems to be telling the reader to use a non-constant expression.


Also, surely this is appropriate for C & Obj-C too?
