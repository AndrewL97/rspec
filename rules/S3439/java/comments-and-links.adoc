When it comes time to implement this one keep in mind that this rule should ONLY apply when the "sessionTransacted" property is left unspecified OR is set to false. In cases where transacted sessions are being used it very well may be desirable to skip processing of the last message that was read during the shutdown process; that message will get redelivered by the JMS broker.
