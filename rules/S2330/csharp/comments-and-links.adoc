I don't get this explanation - I think we need a real example where something fails

Note that we probably also want an issue here:


----
FillWithOranges(new Apple[1]); // Noncompliant
void FillWithOranges(Fruit[] fruits) { fruits[0] = new Orange(); }
----

and that, in an ideal world, we would actually be able to flag the ``++FillWithOranges++`` method which should be refactored to take ``++Orange[]++`` as argument


I'm thinking that we can change this rule to something like: Don't assign into arrays of A when there exists subtypes of A.


So, on the trivial example:

----
object[] a = new string[42]; // This is actually OK - as long as we only plan to read from "a" then nothing bad will happen
a[0] = 42; // Noncompliant - here the rule determines that "a" is an array of "object", for which it is able to find many derived types ({{string}}, {{Int32}}, etc.)

WDYT [~ann.campbell.2]?

\[~ann.campbell.2] can you create a separate rule, which is an actual bug detection rule based on this one?


This rule says that we should report on ``++Fruit[] fruits = new Apple[1];++``, however, that's perfectly fine, that line won't throw an exception. The problem comes when we try to put a non-``++Apple++`` derived fruit in the array. So we should mark this line: ``++fruits[i] = new Orange();++`` that there is a potential bug here. 


However, currently we have no way of finding these real bugs. So that's why I would create a separate rule.
