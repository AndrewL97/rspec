``++volatile++`` can be used to qualify many objects in C and {cpp}, but only a few of the possible places have a well-defined meaning (global variables and local variables for instance). There is no well-defined meaning to the use of volatile to qualify a function return type, a function parameter, or a structured binding. Since {cpp}20, these uses are deprecated, but even before you should not use volatile in those places.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
int volatile f(int volatile i); // Noncompliant, both for the return type and the parameter

void g() {
  auto volatile [a, b] = getPair(); // Noncompliant
}
