*Implementation details*:

*In .Net Core*

The following block is generally generated automatically by the IDE:

----
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    app.UseDatabaseErrorPage();
}
----
However after looking in Github it seems that developers often copy paste the content of the "if" block outside of the "if", which creates a vulnerability.


The rule should not try to detect every possible "if" statement. It should instead check that, if there is a call to ``++app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage()++`` or ``++app.UseDatabaseErrorPage()++``, it is in the exact "if" statement ``++if (env.IsDevelopment())++``.

*TODO once we have a solution for analyzing configuration files*:

For .Net Framework applications

----
<!-- Web.config file -->
<configuration>
...
  <system.web>
    <customErrors mode="Off"/>  <!-- Sensitive -->
    <trace enabled="true"/> <!-- Sensitive -->
    <compilation debug="true"/> <!-- Sensitive -->
  </system.web>
</configuration>
----
*Recommendation:*

The .Net Framework offers different debug features which can be enabled in the Web.config file. Add a Web.config transformation file, for "Release" publications, disabling ``++debug++``, ``++trace++`` and enabling ``++customErrors++``. This will prevent those properties from being published on production servers.

The application should run by default in the most secure mode, i.e. as on production servers. This is to prevent any mistake. Do not commit Web.config file with ``++trace++`` enabled or ``++customErrors++`` disabled. If these features are needed for debug deployment, do it in the ``++Web.Debug.config++`` transform file.
