Labels are available in more languages than JavaScript & Flex (e.g. Java). Is this rule targeted only to those two languages because the use of labels in other languages is not to be encouraged/tolerated at all?

Indeed Ann, this rule should be applied also for Java, example of weird code:

{noformat}

class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    label: {

      System.out.println("1");

      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i{plus}{plus}) {

        break label;

      }

      System.out.println("2");

    }

  }

}

{noformat}

But IMO it's not easy to list all languages, for which this rule applicable, because some language standards / implementations may do not have labels or forbid usage as goto. For example as far as I know no labels in Python - see \http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3136/
