\[~nicolas.peru] after writing this rule up, I noticed that its analog is commented-out:

        /**

* Since you can change the number of core threads for a scheduled

So... what do you think of a smarter implementation (I'd have to update the description) that detects when it's set to zero & left that way?

This is way harder. The "left that way" part can concern a lot of code not under analysis scope.

Do you feel the rule has value as-is or should we scrap it as was done in FB?

Let's reimplement it as what was done in FB. Scheduled for 3.0.
