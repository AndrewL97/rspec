``++CoSetProxyBlanket++`` and ``++CoInitializeSecurity++`` both work to set the permissions context in which the process invoked immediately after is executed. Calling them from within that process is useless because it's too late at that point; the permissions context has already been set.


Specifically, these methods are meant to be called from non-managed code such as a {cpp} wrapper that then invokes the managed, i.e. C# or VB.NET, code.
