After discussion, rule only checks for tests against ``++>0++``, so this is ignored: ``++if (str.indexOf('a') >  1)++``

\[~ann.campbell.2] this rule talks about both lists and strings, but the error message explicitly mentions strings. Also, the rule seems to only check for ``++>0++``, but the message says ``++n++``.
