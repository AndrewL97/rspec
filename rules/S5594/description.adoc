If an Android component is exported and no permissions are defined then other mobile apps can interact with it and perform potential unauthorized actions.


For instance, an exported content provider can expose sensitive data, if no permissions are defined, to other mobile apps.


It's highly recommended to implement restrictive permissions on exposed components.
