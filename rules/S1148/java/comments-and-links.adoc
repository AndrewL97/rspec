Hi! Pretty new around here, so I don't know if it's the best option to discuss some specifics of this rule. I'll welcome any criticism or redirection to another channel of communication!


I'm 100% onboard with flagging calls to ``++Throwable#printStackTrace()++``, without arguments. However, there are (IMHO) valid use cases for printing the stacktrace to a ``++PrintWriter++``, such as displaying relevant error messages in a UI (while still logging it to file / console). Obviously, this only makes sense in local apps and not in webapps at all.


One example of such usage is available on \http://code.makery.ch/blog/javafx-dialogs-official/#exception-dialog. I feel it would be overkill to use a specific Logger for that case.


This rule is flagged as CRITICAL in the default profile, which I find perfectly valid for the genuinely bad calls to ``++Throwable#printStackTrace()++``. However, I would like to be able to set a lower severity level for calls with a specific writer, which reflect a decision from the developper and are not included in the default templates for catch blocks :)


Would you consider splitting this rule in two (with / without args) to allow for different severity levels? Or do you consider this a cornercase, in which case I should add my own rules to override this one?
