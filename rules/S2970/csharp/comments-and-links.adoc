\[~ann.campbell.2] It seems okay. 


Do we mark somehow rules that are library dependent? For example, out of the box we only have ``++Assert.IsTrue++`` and ``++Assert.AreEqual++``-like assertions. With those, this rule doesn't make sense. But when you add a library like "FluentAssertions", you could write "something.Should();" instead of "something.Should().NotBeNull()".

\[~tamas.vajk] should we expand the examples to include: 

----
Assert;  // Noncompliant

----
Assert.AreNotSame(actual,"");

? Does the noncompliant version compile?

\[~ann.campbell.2] No, ``++Assert;++`` on its own doesn't compile.
