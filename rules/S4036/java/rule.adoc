The full path of the command is not specified and thus the executable will be searched in all directories listed in the ``++PATH++`` environment variable:

System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");  // Sensitive
----

The command is defined by its full path:

----
System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/usr/bin/make");  // Compliant
----
