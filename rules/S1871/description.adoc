Having two `+cases+` in a `+switch+` statement or two branches in an `+if+` chain  with the same implementation is at best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error. If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, then in an `+if+` chain they should be combined, or for a `+switch+`, one should fall through to the other.
