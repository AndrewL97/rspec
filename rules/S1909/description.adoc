Use of ``++goto++`` can lead to programs that are extremely difficult to comprehend and analyse, and possibly to unspecified behavior.

Unfortunately, removing ``++goto++`` from some code can lead to a rewritten version that is even more difficult to understand than the original. Therefore, limited use of ``++goto++`` is sometimes advised. 

However, the use of ``++goto++`` to jump into or out of a sub-block of code, such as into the body of a ``++for++`` loop is never acceptable, because it is extremely difficult to understand and will likely yield results other than what is intended.
