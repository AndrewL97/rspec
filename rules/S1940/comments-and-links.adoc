It is wrong that \"``++!(a>2)++``" is equivalent to \"``++a<=2++``".


In case a == NaN (not a number), any compare to it will give "false". ``++(a>2) == false++`` and ``++(a<=2) == false++``. Therefore, "!(a>2)" will be ``++true++`` while "a+<=+2" ``++false++``.


Equivalent of \"``++!(a>2)++``" would be \"``++(a<=2) || (double.IsNaN(a))++``" or \"``++(a<=2) || (float.IsNaN(a))++``" which is easier to read but longer to execute.


One can

* check whether comparison contains any float/double values that can be Not-A-Number _or_
* at least warn a user that it is not the same _or_
* remove this restriction
