I believe this rule is not appropriate for Java also and we should deprecate it.  In Java, no modifier means package visibility, which is a specific kind of visibility, one of the four available "private", "protected", "public" and "package". It is just an unfortunate feature of Java that this access modifier cannot be specified with a specific keyword, but it can't be replaced. We have better rules related to access specification like RSPEC-2386

I agree with your reasoning as package visibility is also quite restrictive. I would however first like to check where this rule comes from. In my experience it is rare to use package visibility. It might be a forgotten "private" field, which would then be a code-smell.
