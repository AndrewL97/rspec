* I've changed this to reliability & added a 'bug' tag since the description says the usage is likely an error (bug tag) & therefore the code doesn't do what you thought it did (reliability).
* There's no need to explicitly mark code as compliant in the Compliant Solution. By definition, there should be no noncompliant code in there. :-)

\[~samuel.mercier] wouldn't this rule also apply to at least C & Obj-C?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I'm wondering how this one relates to RSPEC-867?

I would say they're two sides of the same coin [~evgeny.mandrikov] - a complimentary, opposing pair: "don't use bools with anything but && (&etc.)" versus "don't use non-bools with && (&etc.)"


If we allowed the restating and combination of MISRA rules, then these might be covered together in a single implementation... ;)

It's not currently clear whether this rule is primarily about bugs or code smells. CPP-1816 has been entered to remove some of the current noise. It's possible other passes will be needed.
