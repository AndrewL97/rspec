\[~ann.campbell.2] Since Swift 2.0 (which is not actually released) there is feature "availability checking".

if #available(iOS 9, *) {
    // use UIStackView
} else {
    // show sad face emoji
}

WDYT May be it's worth mentioning in this rule?  (smth like "But to able to run some pieces of code only on specific OS releases you can use availability checking (since Swift 2.0)")

UPDATE I've attached screenshot from documentation (it's from book and it doesn't allow me copy content)

I like it [~elena.vilchik] but I'm wondering about timing. Are you not likely to implement this rule until after Swift 2.0 is released?

\[~ann.campbell.2] ok, let's keep it for Swift 2.0 release (ticket created SWIFT-162)

\[~ann.campbell.2] Actually availability-checking should be compliant :) This piece should help people facing this rule to fix the issue by replacing preprocessor directives by ``++if #available ...++``.
