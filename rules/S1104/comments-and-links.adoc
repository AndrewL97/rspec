\[~nicolas.harraudeau] there is an overlap between RSPEC-2357 ... given it doesn't make sense for both to be enabled, what could we do - deprecate  RSPEC-2357 in favor of this one? or am I missing something?

\[~andrei.epure] Indeed, from a specification point of view there are only minor difference between these two rules. Deprecating RSPEC-2357, which is not in sonar way, in favor of RSPEC-1104 is a good idea IMHO.


Could you just check if the implementations differ in any significant way? I don't see how we got two implementations of the same rule.
