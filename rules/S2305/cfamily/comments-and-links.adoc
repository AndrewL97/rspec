\[~ann.campbell.2] hard to answer on this question as I'm not originator of this RSPEC, but quoting your description:

____
The iostream.h header was provided with the first {cpp} compiler,

\[~ann.campbell.2] seems that this rule has been implemented long ago - see CPP-322. So I added "Legacy Key", please double check.


Also maybe you have an automated way to find all implementations, which are not associated with RSPECs ?
