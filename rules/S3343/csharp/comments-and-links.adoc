\[~ann.campbell.2] I modified the sample code: there can't be any parameter without a default value after parameters with default values. (So I added the ``++null++`` default value to the ``++message++``)


And also modified the last sentence. It is possible to not specify all parameters in a call, but then you force the callers of this method to use named arguments.
