Reverting the rule name to "Image tags should have "width" and "height" attributes" (removing the requirement for buttons) as this rule's implementation does not check buttons and there has been no request or complains from community.


Note also that this rule is not enabled on Peach nor on Next, and it is not part of Sonar-Way. Thus the value of this rule seems quite dubious to me. Especially as it is quite common to define the width and height of images in CSS files.


\[~alexandre.gigleux] Shouldn't we deprecate such a rule?
