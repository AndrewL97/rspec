Because ``case`` statements in a Swift ``switch`` do not fall through, there is no need to use ``break`` at the end of a ``case`` unless it would otherwise be empty. Since an empty ``case`` isn't allowed, an explicit ``break`` is needed to make such code compilable. There is no other reason to use ``break`` in a ``case``.
