`+Thread.Suspend+` and `+Thread.Resume+` can give unpredictable results, and both methods have been deprecated. Indeed, if `+Thread.Suspend+` is not used very carefully, a thread can be suspended while holding a lock, thus leading to a deadlock. Other safer synchronization mechanisms should be used, such as `+Monitor+`, `+Mutex+`, and `+Semaphore+`.
