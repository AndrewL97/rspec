This rule does not appear to be working for https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#init-only-variables[Dataclass Init-Only variables]:


----
@dataclass
class Book:
    name: str     
    condition: InitVar[str] = ''

____Assign to "condition" a value of type "InitVar[str]" instead of "str" or update its type hint.____


In fact, most examples including the official documentation use ``++None++`` as the default for init-only arguments. Attempting to use ``++InitVar[Optional[str]]++`` has the same effect as above.
