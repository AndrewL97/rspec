\[~tamas.vajk] I've just mapped this parent task to SpecifyACultureInStringConversionExplicitly for SONARCSANA-178. I'm wondering if this rule's other cases cover any other R# rules.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Looks good. I added a few more R# IDs to the parent RSPEC.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I modified the scope of this rule. Only operations specified on ``++String++`` are left here, ``++IEnumerable<String>++`` operations have been removed. The main reason is that we we can't force users to define an ``++IComparer++`` for these operations, as it's unreasonably long (in contrary to the ``++IFormatProvider++``, which can be added as a ``++CultureInfo++``). Here is how it's done in .NET4.5: ``++new string[] { }.OrderBy(s => s, Comparer<string>.Create((x, y) => x.CompareTo(y)))++``, but for prior versions you would need to declare a new class and instantiate that.


Another thing that has been removed is the ``++==++``, which is culture specific, but I don't think that we want to force .NET devs to use ``++Equals++`` instead.
