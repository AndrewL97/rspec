\[~jeanchristophe.collet] Could you please update message for this rule? Something like "Review this function declated inside loop and make sure it is not called after loop ends and it doesn't depend on variables updated with each iteration." (\https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-javascript/issues/573)

Function declared inside is a problem when using ``++var++`` declaration for counter. This is very unlikely that in TS somebody will use ``++var++``. So this rule will have very low ROI. So we will not implement it for TS.
