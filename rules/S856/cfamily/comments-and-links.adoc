\[~ann.campbell.2] I will flag it as a bug. Anyway the cases allowed by this rule seems also buggy:

* Conversion between pointers and integral types can result in loss of bits depending on the target architecture and the chose integral type. Also manipulating a pointer as integer is probably meaningless.
* Conversion between pointers to objects requires the objects to have a common part (which is unmaintainable) and should be avoided.
* Conversion to ``++void *++`` loses the information of the underlying type, so apart for calling free or realloc I don't see the point. But for this particular cases the conversion is implicit and does not requires a cast.
so this rule seems odd to me...
