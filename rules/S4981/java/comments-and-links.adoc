\[~tibor.blenessy] Can you review the title of this RSPEC to make it compliant with our title policy?

I suggest something like: "Primitive types for non-null values should preferred to boxed types".

I believe it would be great to write a sentence or two to explain what wrong can happen. Why this is so bad to used boxed type? Is it a performance problem, a memory problem?

Also in the Java code sample, we don't see/understand why this is bad to used boxed type. I believe you should had a ``++if x == null++`` to justify.

\[~alexandre.gigleux] I don't understand the question, nothing wrong can happen, it's just confusing, that's what is explained in the rspec. Call me if we need to discuss further
