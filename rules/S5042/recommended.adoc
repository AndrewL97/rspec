== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Define and control the ratio between compressed and uncompressed data, in general the data compression ratio for most of the legit archives is 1 to 3.
* Define and control the threshold for maximum total size of the uncompressed data.
* Count the number of file entries extracted from the archive and abort the extraction if their number is greater than a predefined threshold, in particular it's not recommended to recursively expand archives (an entry of an archive could be also an archive).
