Any attempt to remove the qualification associated with the addressed type by using casting is a violation of the principle of type qualification. Notice that the qualification referred to here is not the same as any qualification that may be applied to the pointer itself.
Some of the problems that might arise if a qualifier is removed from the addressed object are:

* Removing a `+const+` qualifier might circumvent the read-only status of an object and result in it being modified;
* Removing a `+const+` qualifier might result in an exception when the object is accessed;
* Removing a `+volatile+` qualifier might result in accesses to the object being optimized away.

Note: removal of the C99 `+restrict+` type qualifier is benign.
