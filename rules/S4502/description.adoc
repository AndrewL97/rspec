Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities occur when attackers can trick a user to perform sensitive authenticated operations on a web application without his consent.


Imagine a web application where an authenticated user can do actions like changing his email address and which has no CSRF protection. A malicious website could forge a web page form to send the HTTP request that change the user email. When the user visits the malicious web page, the form is automatically submitted in his name and his account email is changed to an arbitrary email.

Such an attack is only possible if the web browser automatically sends authentication information to the trusted domain (e.g cookie based authentication)
