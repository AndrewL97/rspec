\[~linda.martin] would this rule be appropriate for any of your other languages? E.G. JavaScript?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I guess you mean the exception ? If so, yes it would definitely be appropriate for JavaScript!

\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] I don't agree with your change to the summary.

On its face it seems to expand the scope of the rule from just conditionals (which the code samples still reflect) to ... everywhere.

OTOH, conditions is the only place they could be redundant, isn't it?


Also, is ``++Boolean++`` (with that spelling/capitalization) a type in every language?

I don't think there was a scope extension [~ann.campbell.2] - this behavior is currently implemented in C#, Java and JavaScript (I didn't check the others).


Regarding the type, I've removed the code tags. Boolean seems to be mostly written with an upper-case B, e.g. \https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type

\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] let me be more explicit, the only place booleans can be redundant is in conditional expressions. Let's not make people think through that layer of logic & reinstate old title.

1. Conditional expression are (in C) of the form ``++foo || bar++`` or ``++foo ? bar : baz++`` - e.g. \https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exefbdtf.aspx

2. Relational expressions are of the form ``++foo == bar++``, ``++foo != bar++``, ``++foo > bar++``, etc.

3. Unary expressions are of the form ``++!foo++``, ``++~foo++``, etc.

4. "Condition" typically refers to the expressions that are controlling ``++if++`` or ``++while++`` statements


Now this rule detects issues in all 4 of these points above:


1. ``++foo() || true++``

2. ``++foo() == true++``

3. ``++!false++``

4. ``++if (foo() == true) /* ... */++`` indirectly by the 3 previous cases


All the 3 cases are also detected outside of conditions, such as in method call arguments: ``++myMethod(foo() || true, foo() == true, !false)++``


So I don't think that mentioning or implying that the scope of this rule to "conditions" is accurate.
