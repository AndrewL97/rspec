Rule is deprecated as it's a wrong in JS:

"0" == false   // true
Boolean("0")   // true

\[~elena.vilchik] if it's wrong, why not just remove it? I'm not generally in favor of jerking the rug out from under users in that manner, but what you're saying is essentially that this rule _is_ a bug. As such, it should be fixed / removed.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I see your point, we deprecated it as the matter of habit. We will remove the rule in the next version (\https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarJS/issues/825), there is no point in fixing it.

Eventually we decided to keep the rule but for ``++==++`` and ``++!=++`` use different message. Even though there are some cases then simple drop of literal will break the code, code is still smelly and should be refactored.
