File names of the entries in a zip archive should be considered untrusted, tainted and should be validated before being used for file system operations. Indeed, file names can contain path traversal attacks ``../`` and lead to arbitrary file access (eg: ``../../../../etc/password``).

This special case of path injection vulnerabilities is called zip slip vulnerabilities.
