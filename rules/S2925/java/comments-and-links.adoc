Looks good.

Only suggestion I have is to put the timeout in the solution longer (2/3s?), otherwise it wouldn't fix the problem of dependency on the environment.

With awaitility we can use larger timeouts but still proceed quickly as soon as the polling conditions is satisfied.

Ok, updated. Thanks for your feedback! Feels free to modify it directly next time!
