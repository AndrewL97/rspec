\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] please take a look at this description, which is copied from Nemo. It doesn't quite make sense to me & reads as a hasty copy/paste of a related rule.

\[~ann.campbell.2] The noncompliant ``++foo;++`` can be seen as a ``++foo++`` procedure call. However, it actually is the label of the previous ``++BEGIN .. END++`` block, because the ``++END++`` was not terminated by a semicolon.


This could potentially reveal a bug in the code.


To avoid any confusion, the label should be on the same line as the ``++END++``

Here's my confusion, [~dinesh.bolkensteyn]: the title is about semicolons and the description is about what line the end-block label is on. So... which should change?


Also, I've updated the code samples a little. Please look them over again.

Make a suggestion [~ann.campbell.2] - i think the title could be something like ``++Block "END" and semicolon ";" should be on the same line++``

\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] I gave up and tested this rule against the Noncompliant example to verify where the issue would be marked. I've updated the rule based on that. Please double-check me.
