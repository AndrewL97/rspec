Title & description currently talk about "expensive copy"... as though there's a "cheap copy" option...?

Hello [~ann.campbell.2],


Yes, a copy is expensive or cheap based on the size of the copied object. So if the user is needlessly copying an integer this rule shouldn't raise an issue as it is a "cheap copy". If the user is copying namesOfTheEntirePopulation(as in the example) that is an "expensive copy" and the rule should trigger.
