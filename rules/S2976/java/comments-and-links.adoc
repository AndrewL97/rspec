Spec looks good. 


\[~ann.campbell.2] I am wondering about the targeted language Groovy : rule is covered by codenarc and AFAIK we don't have any intention to develop our own groovy analyzer. So should it be covered instead of targeted for groovy ?

I wouldn't mark it covered based on a 3rd-party tool. I set it to targeted in case we ever do decide to write our own Groovy rules.
