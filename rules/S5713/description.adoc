Repeating an exception class in a single `+except+` statement will not fail but it is not what the developer intended. Either the class is not the one which should be caught, or this is dead code.

Having a subclass and a parent class in the same `+except+` statement is also useless. It is enough to keep only the parent class.

This rule raises an issue when an exception class is duplicated in an `+except+` statement, or when an exception class has a parent class in the same `+except+` statement.
