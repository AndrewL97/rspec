== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

To avoid ``++catastrophic backtracking++`` situations, when possible:

* The maximum number of expected repetitions should be defined with the corresponding quantifier, like ``++\{1,5\}++`` instead of ``+++++`` for instance.
* Refactor ``++nested quantifiers++`` to limit the number of way the inner group can be matched by the outer quantifier, for instance this nested quantifier situation ``++(ba+)+++`` doesn't cause performance issues, indeed, the inner group can be matched only if it exists exactly one ``++b++`` char per repetition of the group.
* Optimize regular expressions with ``++possessive quantifiers++`` and ``++atomic grouping++``.
