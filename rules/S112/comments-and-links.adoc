Changed "generic " to "general" mainly because of \http://english.stackexchange.com/a/167227, but also in C# (and AFAIK in Java too) generic means other things.

Thanks for the notification [~valeri.hristov]. I've reverted. 


In the SE answer you cite, the first definition listed for "generic" is: 

____of, applicable to, or referring to all the members of a genus, class, group, or kind; general.

____
which is the sense intended here. All ``++Exception++`` subtypes (to use a Java example) are ``++Exceptions++``
