In Unix, "others" class refers to all users except the owner of the file and the members of the group assigned to this file. 


In Windows, "Everyone" group is similar and includes all members of the Authenticated Users group as well as the built-in Guest account, and several other built-in security accounts.


Granting permissions to these groups can lead to unintended access to files.
