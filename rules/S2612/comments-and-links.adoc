\[~eric.therond] not to be a PITA, but if `others` has access, then all access _is_ authorized, and there can be no "unauthorized" access, right? Perhaps you meant "unintended"? Also, IMO this description could benefit from being fluffed up a little with a tiny bit reminder of how file permissions are granted to owner, group, others

Indeed, "unintended" is more appropriate.

I prefer to have a short rule description rather than explaining how file permissions work, and the code examples in the different sub-tasks or the links in the "see section" can help the user figure this out.
