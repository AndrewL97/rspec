In AWS, Long-term access keys will be valid until you manually revoke them. This makes them highly sensitive as any exposure can have serious consequences and should be used with care.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* You are in an application or AWS CLI scripts running on an Amazon EC2 instance.
* You need to grant cross-account access.
* You are in a mobile application context.
* You want to federate into AWS and your organization supports SAML 2.0.
* You want to federate into AWS and your organization has an on-premises identity store. 

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

You should consider using IAM roles or other features of the AWS Security Token Service that provide temporary credentials, limiting the risks.


== Sensitive Code Example

----
import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentials;
import com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials;
// ...

AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(accessKeyId, secretAccessKey);
----
