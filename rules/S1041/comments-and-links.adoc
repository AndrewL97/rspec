\[~samuel.mercier] please correct the following

* Code should be quoted in the message. Also, IMO curly braces are not needed here
* Add a See section to the description listing the appropriate MISRA number
* Since the description cites an additional MISRA rule, I would add an h3. See Also section under the See section
* Fill in Applicability.
* Make sure the appropriate MISRA C and MISRA {cpp} fields on the references tab are filled in
* Add misra-{cpp} tag
