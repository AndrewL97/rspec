This rule seems to overlap almost completely with https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-2681[S2681]


Given the non-compliant example:


----
if (condition)  // Noncompliant
doTheThing();
doTheOtherThing(); // <- S2681 "This line will not be executed conditionally; only the first line of this 3-line block will be ..."
somethingElseEntirely();

foo();
----

Fixing the indentation or using blocks stops S2681 from raising. Do we need both rules?


\[UPDATE] The wording of this rule and S2681 and examples have been updated.

Adding VB.NET and VB6 as irrelevant because by design you always have a block.
