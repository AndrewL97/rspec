*Implementation details*:

The functions listed above don't support prepared statements, thus the only way to provide parameters is to concatenate strings. An issue will be created if it cannot be proven that the SQL string is hardcoded. For example an issue will be created if the SQL string is provided as a variable to the current method. If on the contrary the variable is local to the method and is assigned a hard-coded string there will be no issue raised.


For other functions which support prepared statement, the default behavior should be inverted. If the string cannot be proven to be concatenated there is no issue. Thus no issue will be created if the SQL string is provided as a variable to the current method.
