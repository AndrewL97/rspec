May I suggest to setup default severity as "Blocker" ? We should not find anymore Dynamic query in the source code without sanitizing.

Fine for me [~ann.campbell.2] and [~sebastien.gioria] to increase the severity to "Blocker"

\[~freddy.mallet] I considered this, but our guidelines specifically say SQL Injection rules should be Critical. Guess I should have annotated the ticket accordingly. :-/

PL/SQL reference https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/literals-substitution-variables-and-bind-variables[here] . Note that for PL/SQL this best practice is not just about security, there's also a performance impact (soft/hard parsing logic).

\[~ann.campbell.2] there is a huge difference between the two rules :

* In PL/SQL, when using Literals or Substitution Variables there is absolutely no risk to change the structure of the SQL request to do something which is not expected -> so we absolutely don't care about the content of literal or substitution variables and a so about the fact that those values should be sanitized. The only overlap between the two rules is the remediation action but the purpose is absolutely not the same

To close the thread, we'll leave PL/SQL here
