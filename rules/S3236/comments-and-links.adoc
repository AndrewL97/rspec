\[~ann.campbell.2] There is no "CallerInfoAttributes" class, the MSDN page \https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh534540.aspx refers to these collectively as Caller Info attributes, that's why I used that in the description and title. I think the title should use "caller info attributes" instead of "CallerInfoAttributes". WDYT?

How about this as a title: Caller info attributes should not be provided explicitly
