Regular expressions are powerful but tricky, and even those long used to using them can make mistakes.

The following should not be used as regular expressions:

* `+.+` - matches any single character. Used in `+replaceAll+`, it matches _everything_
* `+|+` - normally used as an option delimiter. Used stand-alone, it matches the space between characters
* `+File.separator+` - matches the platform-specific file path delimiter. On Windows, this will be taken as an escape character
* `+[]+` - empty character class doesn't match anything
