In a Zen-like manner, "NULL" is never equal to anything, even itself. Therefore comparisons using equality operators will always return ``False``, even when the value actually ``IS NULL``.

For that reason, comparison operators should never be used to make comparisons with ``NULL``; ``IS NULL`` and ``IS NOT NULL`` should be used instead. This extends as well to empty string (""), which is equivalent to ``NULL`` for some database engines.
