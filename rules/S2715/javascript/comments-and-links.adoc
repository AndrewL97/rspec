\[~linda.martin] it would be nice to have a bit fuller description here discussing what happens if you don't use ``++find++``

\[~ann.campbell.2] as using ``++find++`` allows not to use Sizzle selector engine for the first selection but ``++document.getElementById()++``, when not using ``++find++`` the whole search will be done with Sizzle engine, which is slower.


 *First case*: will do a first fast sort with the ID through native operation (document.getElementById()) then narrows down by launching the Sizzle engine

 *Second case*: we directly launch the Sizzle engine with the whole request, which is slightly heavier and  slower.


It is just a question of performance so when ``++find++`` will be used it will be faster, when not it will be slower.
