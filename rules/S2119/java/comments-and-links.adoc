At the moment : none. 

So this rule won't detect that your random object is initialized in an init method.


It might makes more sense to actually detect Random local variables.

\[~nicolas.peru] you mean local ``++Random++`` variables, right? :-)

(I did actually have to read that twice & note the capital letter to understand your meaning :-) )


I'd say that as written, this rule is about local ``++Random++``s (did you assign it back to me because you don't agree?), but I was hoping to be able to make it smarter. Oh well.

This RSPEC is for now limited to detecting local variables of type ``++java.util.Random++``.

It could later cover cases where the Random object is not even assigned:

----
(new Random()).nextInt()
----
