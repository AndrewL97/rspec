According to an http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6SG3_3.4.0/com.ibm.entcobol.doc_3.4/igym1370.htm[IBM documentation], there may be an issue when switching from IBM COBOL to any version of IBM *Enterprise* COBOL: this documentation is about "Enterprise COBOL for z/OS 3.4.0" and the page starts with "This chapter describes the differences between the IBM COBOL language and the Enterprise COBOL language".
