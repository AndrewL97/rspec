Removing broken link, replacing it by new one.


This rule actually goes against what is said in the link (and does not make much sense). We should replace it by a set of rule about safe usage of lambdas.


Rules currently in this set: RSPEC-5019

Other rules should follow, when the set is done, we should deprecate this rule.
