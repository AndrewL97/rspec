Double-check my changes [~linda.martin].


Also, should we add a compliant solution showing the addition of an undefined-check?. E.G.

----
if (foo !== undefined) {
  foo():
  //...
----
?

Deprecating rule.

We realized that this rule was never behaving very well, most of the issues that we could observe were false positive. Even with the current migration improvement, we will not have the tools to improve the results to a state where it's worth the migration effort, we therefore decided to deprecate it.
