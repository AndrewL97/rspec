\[~geoffray.adde], [~loic.joly] this description starts, essentially with "boolean arguments confusing / bad" and then moves on to "1 boolean arg okay 2+ bad". Which leaves me wondering what happened to boolean arguments being bad? I think some additional content/wordsmithing is needed here.

\[~ann.campbell.2]The plan was the following:

* bool can be confusing
* 1 argument : We have ways to deal with the confusion
* More than one : Those ways no longer work

Do you find this plan more reasonable, and if yes, what can we do t make it more explicit?

The middle bullet, is what I find missing in the current version. Maybe just add it in? :)

\[~loic.joly] it's too weak after the strength of the first paragraph. We need a balance between the two.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Are the strength/weaknesses better balanced now?

Much better balance [~loic.joly]. I've done a little wordsmithing. See if you approve.
