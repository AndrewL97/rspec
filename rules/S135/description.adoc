Restricting the number of ``++break++`` and ``++continue++`` statements in a loop is done in the interest of good structured programming. 


Only one ``++break++`` or one ``++continue++`` statement is acceptable in a loop, since it facilitates optimal coding. If there is more than one, the code should be refactored to increase readability.
