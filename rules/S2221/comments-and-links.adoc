My 2 cents [~ann.campbell.2]:

* For me this rule duplicates RSPEC-1181 in Java
* And catching an Exception in Java is not at all an issue. I would even say that this is a good practice at some levels when you want to be sure to catch all possible exceptions. this is only an issue if you catch Error or Throwable exception

\[~freddy.mallet] I specifically asked [~nicolas.peru] about that & he disagreed & saw this as separate from RSPEC-1181.

I'm going to say it differently : as a Java developer I do believe that this rule is useless and even misleading. Indeed the best practice is the following one:

* Most of the time we should catch only specialized exceptions
* But as soon we are located at the boundary of a technical stack (SonarQube <-> Plugins, Web <-> EJB, ...), generic exceptions (but not Throwable and Error, see RSPEC-1181) should be caught.

So if we activate this rule on our own portfolio, we'll generate lot of false-positives.

\[~freddy.mallet] it sounds like you'd like to see this rule closed. Does the fact that it replaces a PMD rule change your mind?

Thanks [~sebastien.gioria]. 

I'm going to skip the CERT reference; it's about ``++throw++``-ing rather than ``++catch++``-ing. Also, I don't understand how this ties to OWASP A6.
