\[~ann.campbell.2] how this relates to MISRA C:2004, 13.3 - "Floating-point expressions shall not be tested for equality or inequality" ? is it a typo and some other reference should be placed instead?

It looks like the original reference was to 2012:13.3, & 2004:13.3 introduced in error during edits

Irrelevant for "go" because the increment and decrement operators are statements and not expressions (to prevent issues related to this rule).

I think it is irrelevant in JavaScript (and Typescript) too. ECMAScript clearly states that expressions are evaluated let-to-right one at a time (if you would like it in C terminology - side effects are applied immediately one at a time) 12.4.4Â http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf


There is no "undefined states" of expression evaluation in JavaScript like in C language. Also referring to Clang coding style standards in Javascript/Typescript rule is quite odd. Overall rule documentation is weak and usage is disturbing. Can you remove it please?
