Serialization event handlers that don't have the correct signature will simply not be called, thus bypassing any attempts to augment the automated de/serialization.

This rule raises an issue when a method marked with one of the following attributes is `+public+`, `+static+`, does not return `+void+`, has type parameters, or does not have a single parameter of type `+System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext+`:

* `+System.Runtime.Serialization.OnSerializingAttribute+`
* `+System.Runtime.Serialization.OnSerializedAttribute+`
* `+System.Runtime.Serialization.OnDeserializingAttribute+`
* `+System.Runtime.Serialization.OnDeserializedAttribute+`
