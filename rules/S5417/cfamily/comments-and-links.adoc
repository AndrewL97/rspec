``++Lambda functions++`` with ``++auto++`` parameters are also template in disguise. ``++auto&&++`` arguments should be treated as forwarding references.

\[~geoffray.adde] in SonarSource we've standardized on a (non-standard) spelling: Noncompliant. And in the compliant solution there's no need to explicitly mark anything compliant because by its nature everything in it is. I've corrected those things in this RSPEC, but for future reference...


Also, Geoffray and [~loic.joly], this RSPEC has no message.


For the references gentlemen, are you confident that these pages on en.cppreference.com will still be around 5 years from now?


And finally, it's not clear to me what Bad Thing will happen if you break this rule. Maybe that's because I'm not conversant in {cpp}. Maybe it's in there implicitly. But remember that we write rule descriptions not for language wizards but for the ones who still have something (a lot?) to learn. :-)

This website is already several years old, is well maintained and updated regularly. Is as become a de facto standard for {cpp}, so even is predictions are hard to make, especially the ones about the future :), we are as confident as can be...


For the message part, I don't think it is displayed anywhere in the rule description, and as such, is can only be used to communicated between the RSPECator and the guy who implements the rule, and is not necessary if they work closely together. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm reluctant to write the message, because quite often, when implementing the rule we discover special cases that require a message change.


Thank you for the bad things that can happen, I'll update the rspec.

According to the {cpp}17 standard, there is a way to define class type deduction guide to make the constructor argument a forwarding reference. We should keep an eye on such example:

----
template <typename T>
struct A {
A(T&&); // Here T&& is forwarding reference because of the deduction guide defined belowe
};
template <typename T> A(T&&) -> A;

\[~loic.joly], all changes are fine by me.
