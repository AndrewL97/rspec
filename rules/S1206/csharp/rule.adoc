There is a contract between `+Equals(object)+` and `+GetHashCode()+`: If two objects are equal according to the `+Equals(object)+` method, then calling `+GetHashCode()+` on each of them must yield the same result. If this is not the case, many collections won't handle class instances correctly.

In order to comply with the contract, `+Equals(object)+` and `+GetHashCode()+` should be either both inherited, or both overridden.
