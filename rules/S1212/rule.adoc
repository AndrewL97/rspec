A source code comply to an architectural model when it fully adheres to a set of architectural constraints. A constraint allows to deny references between classes by pattern.

You can for instance use this rule to :

* forbid access to `+**.web.**+` from `+**.dao.**+` classes
* forbid access to `+java.util.Vector+`, `+java.util.Hashtable+` and `+java.util.Enumeration+` from any classes
* forbid access to `+java.sql.**+` from `+**.ui.**+` and `+**.web.**+` classes
