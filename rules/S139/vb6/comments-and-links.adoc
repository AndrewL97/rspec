\[~ann.campbell.2] I was loosing this exception when synchronizing RSPECs with HTML. I simply added it back in order to keep this behavior visible the same way it was described before (and to not loose it from in the generated html). If you see a better way to mention that behavior, I let you rephrase it, and I'll resync.
