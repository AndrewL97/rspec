\[~ann.campbell.2] This subtask seems to be totally different from its parent task. The parent task exits the execution of the program, while this one is more like using ``++break++`` statements or ``++goto++``s. Should we map it to something else?

\[~tamas.vajk] leaving the code samples aside, the subtask does describe the same thing as the main task if you look at the first half of the description. 


Do you verify that the descriptive task is accurate and relevant? And if so, can you supply new code samples?
