Please review.


The trick here is to report a correct error message.

I am not sure we should detect indirect equality detection as stated in main description (see previous link).

I am also wondering about a recommandation to use BigDecimal.compareTo instead of a float equality. 


I think we should definitely detect those float (in)equality but I am really wondering about what we should recommend as a fix for this issue.

Having finally read some of the reference you provided, I've updated the description to offer 3 courses of action

* just don't do it
* just a Number such as BigDecimal
* compare vs margin of error

Also, I had inadvertently deleted the wrong code sample. Noncompliant code restored to last state (still missing indirect equality tests) and Compliant solution removed.
