``NaN`` is not equal to anything, even itself. Testing for equality or inequality against ``NaN`` will yield predictable results, but probably not the ones you want. 

Instead, the best way to see whether a variable is equal to ``NaN`` is to use ``Number.isNaN()``, since ES2015, or (perhaps counter-intuitively) to compare it to itself. Since ``NaN !== NaN``, when ``a !== a``, you know it must equal ``NaN``.
