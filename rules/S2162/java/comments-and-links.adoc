=== Rule replacement: RSPEC-2161

We're advising the opposite in the compliant solution of rule RSPEC-2097 @Ann. And we're doing that because 95% of the time, developers are using ``++instanceof++`` operator which is more readable than checking the equality of classes. 


I guess this rule might remain valuable in some specific contexts but I would not activate it by default.

\[~freddy.mallet] I've updated RSPEC-2097 because the old example was broken for child classes since the advice is to use the parent class' ``++equals++`` method for parent class fields and check child class fields in the child's ``++equals++`` method.

FYI [~freddy.mallet], I followed, then reversed your advice and combined this with EQ_CHECK_FOR_OPERAND_NOT_COMPATIBLE_WITH_THIS instead since both rules look at symmetry.

Ok @Ann and I would merge this rule with RSPEC-2161
