Actually [~evgeny.mandrikov] RSPEC-2392 used to be a subtask of RSPEC-1899 but was promoted because RSPEC-1899, like this rule, is only about moving vars down from global to local scope. In JavaScript they can move in both directions.


And because this is a MISRA rule, there are of course related rules (RSPEC-825). Since neither this rule nor RSPEC-825 is implemented yet, would you like to roll them all together?
