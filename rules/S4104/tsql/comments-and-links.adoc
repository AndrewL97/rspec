The title should be changed: subqueries are expressions, and the problem described in this RSPEC only applies to COALESCE, IFF and CASE.


Also, if my understanding is correct:

----
CASE (select...) WHEN... END -- Noncompliant
CASE... WHEN (select...)... END -- Compliant

Nitpicking: it's fine to have a subquery inside a ``++WHEN++`` inside a ``++CASE++``, so we should maybe change "as well as CASE expressions" to "as well as expressions immediately following the CASE keyword".
