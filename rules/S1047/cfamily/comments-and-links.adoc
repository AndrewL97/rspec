\[~samuel.mercier] please correct the following

* There is no message
* Add a See section to the description listing the appropriate MISRA number
* Fill in Applicability.
* Make sure the appropriate MISRA C and MISRA {cpp} fields on the references tab are filled in
* I would not use Maintainability/Understandability for an "undefined behavior" rule. In fact, I doubt Maintainability is applicable to many MISRA rules at all. I would assign this one to reliability, instead
