Isn't there some overlap with RSPEC-2251, even if RSPEC-2251 is not strictly speaking detecting infinite loops?

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] conceptually, maybe there is, but not semantically. In fact, this got split into two distinct cases/rules because of the semantic difference between 

``++while(true)++`` (truly infinite loop) and ``++for (int i=0; i < 10; i--)++`` (inadvertently long loop)


And maybe I'm remembering incorrectly, but I have the sense that the discussion that lead to the split was with you. :)


As a side note, I've updated the code samples to remove the inadvertently long loop.
