\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] what about a property which has logic in one of the methods but not the other?

I've tested that yesterday [~ann.campbell.2], it's not possible: There is no way to explicitly access the implicit backing field, so there is no way to add any logic to an auto-property.

\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] I'm not sure I was clear. I'm talking about something like this:

----
  private string _make;
  public string Make // Noncompliant
  {
    get { return _make; }
    set 
    {
      // do stuff to value... 
      _make = value; 
    }

So you actually mean:


----
  private string _make;
  public string Make
  {
    get { return _make; }
    set 
    {
       if (value == null)
       {
         throw new SomeException();
       }
      _make = value; 
    }
  }

That is perfectly valid and compliant. There is nothing that can be improved there.
