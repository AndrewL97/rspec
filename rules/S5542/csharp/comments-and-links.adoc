\[~eric.therond] Note that C# has a GCM mode since .NET Core 3.0 (See \https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/31389), but not yet in .NET Framework. It would be nice to have this mentioned as an alternate Compliant Solution.

Also, the rule mentions "RSA encryption algorithm should be used with the recommended padding scheme (OAEP)", but there is no example for such Noncompliant/Compliant code example.
