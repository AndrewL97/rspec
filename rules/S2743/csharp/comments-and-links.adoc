This is the first draft of this rule, I don't know which properties need to be set. (SQALE, tags, ...)

\[~tamas.vajk] if you'll expand the description to include the reasons (bad thing that will happen if you break the rule or good thing that will happen if you follow it) that will help me with filling in the other fields.

Ann, I've added an exception to this rule, could you please check it?

Thanks

The exception looks fine, but I think it would be helpful if you added a small code sample. 

You can use a "// Compliant" or "// Ignored" comment to mark the line that's being ignored.

Added the code sample as well to the Exception
