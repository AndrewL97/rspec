\[~ann.campbell.2] Why was this RSPEC closed and the legacy key removed?

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] the legacy key was moved to RSPEC-1067, which has the modernized version of the title that comes up on nemo when you search for 'COBOL.ConditionComplexityCheck'. And at that point, this rule seemed like a duplicate, although on closer inspection, perhaps it's a separate issue & this rule should be reopened? (Altho not with that legacy key.)

Currently, the COBOL plugin implements the following rule:

* name: Avoid too complex conditions
* key: COBOL.ConditionComplexityCheck
Its behavior is the one described for RSPEC-2982: it's not related to cyclomatic complexity but to "distinct data items".


I can't find any implementation of RSPEC-1067 in the current version of the COBOL plugin.

Sorry about that [~pierre-yves.nicolas]. I'm returning this to your queue.
