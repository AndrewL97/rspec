\[~pierre-yves.nicolas], I wrote the exception based on http://supportline.microfocus.com/Documentation/AcucorpProducts/docs/v6_online_doc/gtman3/gt3678.htm[this] but suspect it should be expanded to include more cases.

\[~ann.campbell.2] The documentation you found is specific to AcuCobol which adds many extensions on top of "standard" COBOL. I suggest to keep only the exception about date/time and to not activate that rule by default.

\[~ann.campbell.2] The scope of this rule changed completely: it used to be "ACCEPT should not be used" and is now "Track uses of forbidden statements". I don't see how we can keep the exception for ``++ACCEPT FROM++`` with the new scope.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] I've reverted this rule & created RSPEC-3938
