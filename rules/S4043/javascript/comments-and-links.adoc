\[~JounQin] I created issue from your report \https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarJS/issues/2513 , however please use our community forum in the future \https://community.sonarsource.com/ ,  this JIRA project should not be used to report specific implementation issues, as it is agnostic about the language.
