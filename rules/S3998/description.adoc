A thread acquiring a lock on an object that can be accessed across application domain boundaries runs the risk of being blocked by another thread in a different application domain. Objects that can be accessed across application domain boundaries are said to have weak identity. Types with weak identity are:

* ``MarshalByRefObject``
* ``ExecutionEngineException``
* ``OutOfMemoryException``
* ``StackOverflowException``
* ``String``
* ``MemberInfo``
* ``ParameterInfo``
* ``Thread``
