@Ann I don't understand why there's a difference between ``++@Transactional++``  and ``++@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)++`` (the default) ?

And I disagree with incompatible propagations list, this is my proposal:

||From||To||

| non-``++@Transactional++`` | MANDATORY, REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW |

| MANDATORY | NESTED, NEVER, NOT_SUPPORTED, REQUIRES_NEW |

| NESTED | MANDATORY, NESTED, NEVER, NOT_SUPPORTED, REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW |

| NEVER | MANDATORY, REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW |

| NOT_SUPPORTED | MANDATORY, REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW |

| REQUIRED or ``++@Transactional++`` | NESTED, NEVER, NOT_SUPPORTED, REQUIRES_NEW |

| REQUIRES_NEW | NESTED, NEVER, NOT_SUPPORTED REQUIRES_NEW |

| SUPPORTS | MANDATORY, NESTED, NEVER, NOT_SUPPORTED, REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW |
