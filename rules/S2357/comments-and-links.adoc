\[~ann.campbell.2] shouldn't we have an exception for constant fields? And how about static ones? Those can't be part of an interface, so the reasoning doesn't apply to them.


For static ones, we have another rule with a different reasoning: \http://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-2223

\[~tamas.vajk] do you have any idea if those exceptions should apply to VB.NET too?

\[~ann.campbell.2] Yes, this applies to VB.Net as well. There ``++static++`` is called ``++Shared++``, and constant variables are marked by ``++Const++``
