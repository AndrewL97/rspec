\[~ann.campbell.2]In the same direction, should we change the message "This [function|method|module|subroutine] "XXXX" has {0} lines, which is greater than the {1} lines authorized. Split it into smaller [functions|methods|modules|subroutines]." to explicitly say "lines of code" instead of just "lines" ?
