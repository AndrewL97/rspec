For some reason, public static final members were previously excluded.

I removed that exclusion to be in sync with the description, and because I don't see why those should be excluded in the first place.

As discussed, public static final fields are excluded from public API because they are usually self descriptive and do not need to be documented.

\[~ann.campbell.2], as discussed with [~nicolas.peru] today, this rule generates some noise/controverses out of the box and even with **.api.** as default value for parameter forClasses. So we would suggest to remove it from the "Sonar way" quality profile.

{color:red}At least 1 line of description which should have more than one word.{color}

if the description is not engilish,may not have space.such as


 /**

* 将字节转为字符(解码)
     *

* @param bytes 字节数组
* @return 字符数组
     */


{empty}.is's a bug??

\[~yuhan0501] That particular section of the rule has been relaxed in SonarJava 4.13 (it doesn't check the number of words any longer) but we forgot to update the RSPEC itself, I apologise for that oversight. I now have updated the RSPEC to reflect that decision.

And you are right, previous implementation had a bug where it ignored localisation.
