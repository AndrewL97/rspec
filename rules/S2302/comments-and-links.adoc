\[~nicolas.harraudeau] - do you see a good reason not to raise an issue when the string is not an exact match? One could include the name of the parameter inside the message like

* ``++"someParameter should have value X"++``

or using interpolated strings

* ``++  $"someParameter should have value X but has value {someParameter}"++``

 


As it is, I don't find the rule as useful as it could be
