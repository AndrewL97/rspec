\[~ann.campbell.2] Your description made me read the PHP Manual, and in addition to what you already have written I saw the following: 

____
As of PHP 5.3.0, you will get a warning saying that "call-time pass-by-reference" is deprecated  [...] *And as of PHP 5.4.0, call-time pass-by-reference was removed, so using it will raise a fatal error.*

____

I don't know if it was already there when you read the Manual, in any case I think it would be worth mentioning it in the description. And why note even quote the Manual ? 


WDYT ?
