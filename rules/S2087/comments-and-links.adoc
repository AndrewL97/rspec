\[~nicolas.peru] I've mapped this to find-sec-bugs:RSA_KEY_SIZE but the CWE page talks mainly about Base64 encoding. Is a key size check doable?

RSA_KEY_SIZE checks the ``++KeyPairGenerator++`` class and the calls to ``++getInstance++`` and ``++initialize++`` methods. 

Those are a little bit different as Base64 is not an encryption mechanism whereas the other is correct but weak. 


We can still squash them into one rule though.
