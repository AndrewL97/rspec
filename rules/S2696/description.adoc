Correctly updating a ``++stati{cpp}`` field from a non-static method is tricky to get right and could easily lead to bugs if there are multiple class instances  and/or multiple threads in play. Ideally, ``++stati{cpp}`` fields are only updated from ``++synchronized stati{cpp}`` methods.

This rule raises an issue each time a ``++stati{cpp}`` field is updated from a non-static method.
