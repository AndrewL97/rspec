\[~tamas.vajk] if this rule comes from R#, please provide the R# rule key.

Also, there is the question of classes that ``++Dispose++`` of their ``++IDisposable++`` members, but not from their own ``++Dispose++`` methods. I.e. they call ``++Dispose++`` from some other, randomly-named method. Does this case merit coverage under this rule? A separate rule?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I think the separate rule for "implementing IDisposable" (\http://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-2931) is a good idea. Let's keep it this way, we'll see if it generates loads of duplicate issues or not.


This rule is not in Resharper.

I edited "block" to "method". Double-check me, please.

Beside the types covered in the description, all types implementing IDisposable should be covered as well. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2000[CA2000]
