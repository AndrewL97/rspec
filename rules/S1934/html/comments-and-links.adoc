@Ann, looks like the list of default values for property 'attributes' is missing. 


BTW, this was not a brand new rule & is not related to HTML 5. It's a catch-up entry for an old rule that was already implemented in the Web plugin but had no RSpec.

\[~freddy.mallet] must there always be a default value? This rule is not on by default, and is a user-specified "don't use this attribute" rule.

Let's say [~ann.campbell.2] that all mandatory properties should have a default value out of the box to prevent generating some analysis failure when activating the rule without providing a property value. But indeed here this is a template rule, so everything is fine.

In the interest of completeness: this RSpec created to document an existing rule in the Web plugin which is neither fish nor fowl (i.e. not a template rule and no defaults)
