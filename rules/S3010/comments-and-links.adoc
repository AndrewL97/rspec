\[~ann.campbell.2] I wonder if there are not some overlaps with \http://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-2444

\[~nicolas.peru] they're both related to the initialization of ``++static++`` fields, but I don't think they overlap. One advocates initialization at declaration and the other that lazy initialization be ``++synchronized++`` or that lazy-initialized vars be ``++volatile++``. 2 different ways to do it wrong and 3 different ways to do it right.


We could combine them, but IMO, it would be unwieldy.
