Linux "`+capabilities+`" allow you to assign narrow slices of `+root+`'s permissions to files or processes. A thread with capabilities bypasses the normal kernel security checks to execute high-privilege actions such as mounting a device to a directory, without requiring (additional) root privileges.

Granting capabilities can lead to privilege escalations.
