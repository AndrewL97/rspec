*Implementation details*:

This rules highlights regular expression patterns. Sometime the pattern is compiled using the ``++new System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Regex++`` constructor, but it can also be in the form of a ``++String++`` fed to one of Regex static methods ``++isMatch++``, ``++Match++``, ``++Matches++``, ``++Replace++``. ``++Split++``. Note that we *do not match non static methods* as the pattern was given to the ``++Regex++`` constructor.
