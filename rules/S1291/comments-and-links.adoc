Be careful, you cannot use ``++S1291++`` as a rule key to implement this rule.


You must use a key that contains "nosonar" (case-insenstive), because of this hack in SonarQube:

----
accepted = noSonarLines == null || !noSonarLines.contains(issue.line());
if (!accepted && StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase(issue.ruleKey().rule(), "nosonar")) {
  accepted = true;
}

There is an issue with this rule where it is not able to be suppressed for imports.


 


How does this rule even make sense? This creates a warning for suppressing a warning, and there is no way to disable the warning of your suppression of the other warning in certain areas of your code.
