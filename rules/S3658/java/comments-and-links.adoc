@[~ann.campbell.2] : I will update the https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-java/pull/902[PR] with your last modifications ASAP (I need update an https://github.com/SonarSource/orchestrator/pull/1[orchestrator PR] before) ; but IMO a remediation cost to 1min (perhaps 2) would be better than 5 (this is a default very quick to fix).
