This is about a https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sonarqube/T-f83S9mvQU[question] on the Google group.


+1 for adding @Resource in this rule. Although annotation @Autowired is well-known among Java developers, it is Spring specific. The newer but standard @Resource annotation is mostly equivalent to @Autowire and should be added to the rule.


I don't know about @Inject - maybe a Guice-specific annotation.


Suggestions:

* Change the rule title into "Members of Spring components should be explicitly injected".
* Give more emphasis to @Resource than to @Autowired, which is slightly outdated. For example, replace
"That is, they should have the @Autowired annotation"

with

"That is, they should have the @Resource (or @Autowired) annotation"

\[~SPoint]: thanks for the contribution - it's already tagged OWASP A3:2017 in the RSPEC ticket - as soon as SonarJava 5.2 will be released, the OWASP tags will be updated in SonarQube UI thanks to this ticket: \https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONARJAVA-2682 - we reviewed all the OWASP tags of SonarJava rules to be sure they are aligned with OWASP TOP 10 2017.

\[~nicolas.harraudeau] despite the fact that Jira can't properly render its own code markdown when immediately followed by non-space characters, RuleAPI handles this correctly. 


The current version is awkward IMO and should either get the 's'es back, or the word "classes" before "are singletons by default".

\[~ann.campbell.2] Thanks for the info. I'll add "classes" then so that it works in both Jira and RuleAPI.
