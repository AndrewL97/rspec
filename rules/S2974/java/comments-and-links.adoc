My personal feedback:

* I would not activate this rule by default as it is controversial -> some guys are going to say that it's useless to flag such classes as final as any way it's by design not possible to extend them
* Due to the previous point I would associate this rule to the SQALE characteristic "Maintainability > Understandability" and not "Changeability - Architecture related changeability"
