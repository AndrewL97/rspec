Making a ``++publi{cpp}`` constant just ``++final++`` as opposed to ``++static final++`` leads to duplicating its value for every instance of the class, uselessly increasing the amount of memory required to execute the application.

Further, when a non-``++publi{cpp}``, ``++final++``  field isn't also ``++stati{cpp}``, it implies that different instances can have different values. However, initializing a non-``++static final++`` field in its declaration forces every instance to have the same value. So such fields should either be made ``++stati{cpp}`` or initialized in the constructor.
