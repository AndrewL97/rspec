I don't like current description, because this rule is not just about little styling. Compare to CERT, which for example contains

____
Failure to declare a void parameter will result in

* An ambiguous functional interface between the caller and callee.
* Sensitive information outflow.
____
Also as a developer I really appreciate references to the language specification in RSPECs.

@Ann, I would also associate this rule to the SQALE characteristic "Reliability". Indeed this rule can definitely be associated to "Maintainability" or to "Reliability". But when there is a doubt "Reliability" should be preferred because operational risks matter more than maintainability issue.
