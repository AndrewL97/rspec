The methods declared in an ``++interface++`` are ``++publi{cpp}`` and ``++abstract++`` by default. Any variables are automatically ``++public static final++``. Finally, ``++class++`` and ``++interface++`` are automatically ``++public stati{cpp}``. There is no need to explicitly declare them so.

Since annotations are implicitly interfaces, the same holds true for them as well.

Similarly, the ``++final++`` modifier is redundant on any method of a ``++final++`` class, ``++private++`` is redundant on the constructor of an ``++Enum++``, and ``++stati{cpp}`` is redundant for ``++interface++`` nested into a ``++class++`` or ``++enum++``.
