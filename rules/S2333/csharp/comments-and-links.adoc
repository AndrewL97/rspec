\[~tamas.vajk] as discussed in the comments of SONARCSANA-197, I've edited this to raise issues on both ``++partial++`` and ``++virtual++``.


Also, I've moved this under an older RSpec as a subtask. There is a mild difference in scope (redundant vs gratuitous keywords) and that's what kept me from making the association the first time around, but on second thought, they're not different enough to sustain the distinction.

\[~ann.campbell.2] Thanks, it looks good. I've added the ``++sealed++`` option as well, which directly comes from the parent task (``++final++`` in Java).
