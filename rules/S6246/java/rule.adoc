Invoking other Lambdas from a Lambda is a scalability anti-pattern. As the runtime of your function is bounded, waiting for another Lambda to finish executing could cause a timeout.


Alternative solutions include:

* Generating events that can be consumed asynchronously by other Lambdas
* Making the Lambda invocation asynchronous

InvokeRequest invokeRequest = new InvokeRequest()
         .withFunctionName("myFunction");

AWSLambdaAsync client = AWSLambdaAsyncClientBuilder.defaultClient();

client.invokeAsync(request); // Compliant
