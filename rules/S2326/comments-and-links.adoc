I think this might make sense for Java (generics) as well [~ann.campbell.2], and perhaps also {cpp} (templates).

\[~dinesh.bolkensteyn] my understanding of this (which is admittedly very shaky) is that in the Noncompliant example there are actually 3 params: a, b, and an as-yet-unnamed param of type T. So I'm not sure how this translates to Java. But I'm happy to add {cpp} (never used templates, so I'll take your word for it. :-) )

Well, here would be a Java example:


----
class MyClass {
  public static <T> void MyMethod() {} // Isn't <T> unused here too?
}

But it's not a parameter, [~dinesh.bolkensteyn]...?
