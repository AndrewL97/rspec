The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected. Standard algorithms like ``++SHA-256++``, ``++SHA-384++``, ``++SHA-512++``, ... should be used instead.

This rule tracks creation of ``++java.security.MessageDigest++`` subclasses.
