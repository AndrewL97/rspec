== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Only use random number generators which are https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#secure-random-number-generation[recommended by OWASP] or any other trusted organization.
* Use the generated random values only once.
* You should not expose the generated random value. If you have to store it, make sure that the database or file is secure.
