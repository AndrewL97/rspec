This rule should be tag OWASP-Top10. It's part of OWASP Top10 A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure.


It could bee tag also : 


* CWE Entry 310 on Cryptographic Issues  (\http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html)
* CWE Entry 326 on Weak Encryption (\http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)

\[~nicolas.harraudeau] where do you expect the issue to be raised? On the ``++rand()++`` call or where the value is used?

\[~ann.campbell.2] On the rand() call. This is a hotspot because we are not yet able to detect if the context is dangerous or not.


We could later detect that an encryption function or a hash is using the generated value, but it would then be classified as a Vulnerability instead of a Hotspot.
