Today, files that are not parsable by SonarQube are completely passed in the analysis phase (eg: Java.) This means that potentially bad content can seep in where SQ is being used as a Pull Request filter. It would be nice if the SonarQube system as a whole had a good answer to this. Today, work-arounds have been made for individual languages (eg: xml) which end up attempting to parse a file up to three times before an issue is raised and reported. All of these work-arounds are somewhat hackish in nature.


The parse phase really needs to be able to directly report lex/parse issues.
