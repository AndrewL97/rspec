\[~ann.campbell.2] Indeed it does not work, JavaScript is tricky:

----
MyObj.func1 = function() {
  if (this.foo == 1) {  // Noncompliant; addresses window.foo => actually it does not it addresses MyObj.foo variable.
    // ...

}

Re-assigned to you: I'll let you update the code snippet in case you have precise ideas about what to put.

Thank you !
