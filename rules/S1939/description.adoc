An `+extends+` or `+implements+` list entry is redundant if:

* It is `+Object+` - all classes extend `+Object+` implicitly.
* It is `+int+` for an `+enum+`
* It is listed multiple times.
* It is a superclass of another listed extension.

Such redundant declarations should be removed because they needlessly clutter the code and can be confusing.
