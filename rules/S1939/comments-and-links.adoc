\[~ann.campbell.2] This rule definitely makes sense for C# - but I don't like "an extension" in the description. I can't understand what it is.

Note that in C#, classes and interfaces are derived from using the following syntax: ``++class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass, MyBaseInterface++``


So the words ``++extends++`` and ``++implements++`` do not appear in the code.
