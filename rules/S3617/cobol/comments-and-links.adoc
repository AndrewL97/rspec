This RSPEC will need to define precisely which DB2 types are "compatible" with which COBOL types.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] take a look at the http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_10.0.0/apsg/src/tpc/db2z_equivalentcoboldatatypes.html[IBM spec] & see if you want to replicate that into the RSpec. Maybe we add that reference to the See section?

\[~ann.campbell.2] The IBM spec definitely helps and shows that it would take a long time to cover all possible cases. We should probably focus on the most common cases that we want to catch. The most basic rule is "don't mix numeric with character". We also have to check the length of variables: the "receiving" side should be long enough to store the "sent" value. I'm not sure how we should describe all of that.
