* this is likely a "pitfall" if not a "bug"
* how do you see these issues being marked? Once on each instance of a declaration? Would it be possible to list the locations (file name + line #) of the other instances?
* FYI, I've switched this from data-related to logic-related. 
* please add a See section

\[~ann.campbell.2] Indeed we should report a single issue listing all declarations. There is a ticket for that. Hopefully the functionality will be available when we implement this rule.
