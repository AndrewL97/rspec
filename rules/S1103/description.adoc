Defining a nested single-line comment within a multi-line comment invites errors. It may lead a developer to wrongly think that the lines located after the single-line comment are not part of the comment.

If a comment starting sequence, `+/*+` or `+//+`, occurs within a `+/*+` comment, is it quite likely to be caused by a missing `+*/+` comment ending sequence.
If a comment starting sequence occurs within a `+//+` comment, it is probably because a region of code has been commented-out using `+//+`.
