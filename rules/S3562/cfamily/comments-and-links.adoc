For some implementation details, RSPEC-131 can't support in C/{cpp} the following exception and so a dedicated rule has been created:

* If the switch parameter is an enum and if all the constants of this enum are used in the case statements, then no default clause is expected
This RSPEC must not be covered by any language except C/{cpp} and Objective-C
