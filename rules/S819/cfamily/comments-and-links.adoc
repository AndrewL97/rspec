Also, MISRA C:2012, 8.2 is the equivalent rule in the later spec, and RSPEC-926 is related to the 2012 definition. I.e. the 2004 definition does not call for parameter names in prototypes, but the 2012 version does.

\[~ann.campbell.2] the scope of this rule and RSPEC-926 is not exactly the same.

The ultimate goal of this rule is to make sure the type of the arguments are the same when the function is defined and called (although the title is not accurate).

RSPEC-926 requires the name of the arguments to be explicitly written, to give more information to the developer about their usage.

\[~samuel.mercier] IMO the ultimate goal of MISRA C:2004 8.1 (this RSPEC) is to require prototype and not to check the type of arguments. But I agree that goal of MISRA C:2004 16.3 (RSPEC-926) is to require names of the arguments in addition. However RSPEC-926 also refers to MISRA C:2012 8.2, which requires both - prototype and names.

The provision of a prototype for a function with internal linkage is a good programming practice.

____
because implicit function declaration is allowed only by C90 standard, but disallowed in later standards, thus this is not just a good practice.

Also this is too strong requirement to have a function prototype before actual definition, so title changed to match MISRA C:2012.

There is no references for {cpp}, so removed from list of targeted languages.
