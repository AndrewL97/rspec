Numbers can be shifted with the ``++<<++`` and ``++>>++`` operators, but the right operand of the operation needs to be an ``++int++`` or a type that has an implicit conversion to ``++int++``. However, with ``++dynami{cpp}``, the compiler's type checking is turned off, so you can pass anything to a shift operator and have it compile. And if  the argument can't be converted to ``++int++`` at runtime, then a ``++RuntimeBinderException++`` will be raised.
