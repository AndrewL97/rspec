User enumeration refers to the ability to guess existing usernames in a web application database. This can happen, for example, when using "sign-in/sign-on/forgot password" functionalities of a website.


When an user tries to "sign-in" to a website with an incorrect username/login, the web application should not disclose that the username doesn't exist with a message similar to "this username is incorrect", instead a generic message should be used like "bad credentials", this way it's not possible to guess whether the username or password was incorrect during the authentication.


If a user-management feature discloses information about the existence of a username, attackers can use brute force attacks to retrieve a large amount of valid usernames that will impact the privacy of corresponding users and facilitate other attacks (phishing, password guessing etc ...).
