\[~tamas.vajk], [~ann.campbell.2] as of today both SLVS-827 and CPP-1477 cover cases such as

{noformat}

switch (...) {

  default:

  case ...:

    ...

}

{noformat}

in which IMO message ``++Remove this empty "case" clause.++`` is misleading, so for CPP-1477 we changed it on ``++Remove this redundant "case" clause.++``
