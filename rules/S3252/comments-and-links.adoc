\[~nicolas.peru] I'm thinking this is applicable to Java, right?

\[~tamas.vajk] would it also be acceptable to do this?

  {
    Count++;
  }

i.e. should we add a version of that as an alternate compliant solution?

\[~ann.campbell.2] [~tamas.vajk] why this is not subtask of RSPEC-2209? which one should be implemented in C-Family?

\[~ann.campbell.2] yes, you could use ``Count{plus}{plus}``, but we shouldn't promote that. And as [~evgeny.mandrikov] pointed out there is a separate rule for that. Note that in C# you couldn't write ``++this.Count++``, or ``++myInstance.Count++``.

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] I don't think that we should merge the two RSPECs. RSPEC-2209 says "static" members should be accessed statically. And here we are doing exactly that, but through a derived class.

\[~tamas.vajk] then why RSPEC-2209 marked as "replaced by" this one?

\[~ann.campbell.2] Looks good for java. I let you sort out in which subtask or rspec this should go but principle is ok for me.

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] Good question. I haven't seen that link. We should probably ask [~freddy.mallet] who linked the two.

I've swapped in a 'related' link instead.
