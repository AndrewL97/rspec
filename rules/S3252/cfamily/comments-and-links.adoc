\[~ann.campbell.2] Given the following {cpp} example:

----
class Parent {
  public:
    static int count;
};

typedef Parent ParentAlias1;
typedef Parent ParentAlias2;

class Child : public ParentAlias2 {
  public:
   Child() {
     Child::count++;
   }
};
----
I'm able to identify:

* the static member name "count"
* the qualifier that prefix the member "Child"

But to be able to create the message:

{code}Replace "X" with "Y".{code}


It's sometime ambigus to propose the replacement, in the above example it can be "Parent", "ParentAlias1" or "ParentAlias2".


That's why I propose a message with only the member name and the qualifier name:

{code} Do not access "Z" with derived type "X".{code}


In this case it would be:

{code} Do not access "count" with derived type "Child".{code}
