\[~ann.campbell.2] I would say "[...] doing so *could* lead to unexpected results.", because it could be expected that not all arguments will be given because some are optionals and the body function will check it.


Also what do you think about adding an exception when ``++arguments++`` is used in the body of the function ? 

E.g

----
function f(a, b, c, d) {
 for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    doSomethingWith(arguments[i]);
  }
}
----

I've changed the wording from 'will' to 'could', but I'm against your proposed exception: it requires the author of the call to examine the code of the method being called, which is just not something you should have to do.

\[~ann.campbell.2] not necessarily, documentation exists exactly for this kind of cases.

So can we narrow the exception, [~linda.martin] to: function is documented (there's a comment immediately before it) AND arguments is used in the body?

What to do with optional parameters? Just check the several first functions from http://underscorejs.org/[underscore.js].

Per discussion with [~elena.vilchik], the too few args case is ignored by this rule.

\[~ann.campbell.2] So no explicit mention of the "exception" in the rule description ?

IMO [~linda.martin] no explicit mention needed of ignoring too few args since specialized title narrows the scope.
