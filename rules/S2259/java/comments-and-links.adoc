@Ann, could you review this sub-task ? Thanks

first example is wrong, since ``++instanceof++`` would return ``++false++`` if ``++obj++`` is ``++null++``.

Interestingly, from null/notnull point of view, ``++a instanceof b++`` is equivalent to ``++a != null++``

Removed message * NullPointerException will be thrown as 'XXXX' is for sure null here, since we are currently unable to make distinction between @Nullable and if (... == null)

It's sonarqube(7.9.1) check implements issue, please fix the issue:)

Thanks for the feedback [~qxo]!

Can you report the FP in the community forum \https://community.sonarsource.com/tags/c/bug/fp/java so it gets more visibility and be addressed?

JIRA comments are not convenient to manage FPs.

Thanks
