"equals" has a special place as a method name: it is expected to override ``++boolean Object.equals(Object)++``. Using the name for a method with some other signature is a recipe for confusion.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public void equals(MyObject o) {  // Noncompliant
  //...
}

public bool equals(MyObject left, MyObject right) {  // Noncompliant
  // ...
}
