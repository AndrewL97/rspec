\[~ann.campbell.2] Could you review this draft? I put it as a ``++Bug Detection++`` as the class is never going to work as expected but I am not sure about the severity.

If everything is find could you change the completeness?

\[~amaury.leve] looks ok to me.

A couple of comments:

* a class can be exported using _Export_ or _InheritedExport_, or a custom attribute that inherits from one of those two attributes.
* there are other MEF attributes like _Import_ and _ImportingConstructor_ that don't make sense unless they are on an exported class. Should we have those as separate rules, or make this rule more generic e.g. "MEF attribute should only be used on exported types"
