== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Don't hard-code the IP address in the source code, instead make it configurable with environment variables, configuration files, or a similar approach. Alternatively, if confidentially is not required a domain name can be used since it allows to change the destination quickly without having to rebuild the software.
