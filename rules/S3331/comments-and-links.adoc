IMO from an implementation point of view this RSPEC is underspecified, so removing targeting for ``{cpp}`` for now.

\[~elena.vilchik] It seems that it would be hard to get real issue with this rule because the domain value for cookie is usually set through variables.

In JavaScript cookies are set through the document object, as the following:

----
document.cookie="username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/; domain=.com";
// But might not be that straightforward
document.cookie="username=" + name + "; expires=" + date + "; domain=" + domains + ";";
----

The return value of an implementation that will detect only the first case is sensitive; and the second case requires a CFG.

So I will let you decide wether or not it would be valuable.

This rule has very little value as it only raise on "single level" cookie (ex: domain=.com). This type of cookie are called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Supercookie[supercookies] and they are denied by all modern web browser.

One option could be to make the rule raise on https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00500300_cookie-scoped-to-parent-domain[cookie scoped to parent domain] (ex: domain=.sonarsource.com) but it would probably be very noisy as this setting is wildly used.

Deprecating this rule seams to be the right thing to do.
