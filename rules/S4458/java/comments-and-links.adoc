Since I just debugged an issue with that class, I'd propose to add ``++java.util.zip.ZipFile++`` to the "dangerous" classes with finalizer... Using an ``++java.util.zip.ZipInputStream++`` avoids the finalizer.

Hello [~tobix],

Can you open a thread on \https://community.sonarsource.com/c/suggestions/rules so we can get more details about the problem you faced? It's much more convenient than using JIRA Comments. 

Thx
