\[~nicolas.peru] are you saying you'd like to roll the content of this rule into RSPEC-1201? Because they're actually about (slightly) different things...

\[~ann.campbell.2] I am saying that this rule should not cover the equals method as it is covered by RSPEC-1201. I don't see the difference between the two rules except that one concern equals and the other one hashcode.

\[~nicolas.peru], this rule doesn't cover "equals" (with an 's'), it covers "equal". I.e. this rule is about method names that are not-quite-right. RSPEC-1201 is about signatures that are not-quite-right. Or are you saying that in the implementation of RSPEC-1201 you also check this spelling variation?

\[~ann.campbell.2]My bad, I really did not spot the difference between the two rules... I tend to think this one should clearly mention that it detects typo. So this mean that not only description but implementation is out of date in plugin. ticket created : \http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SONARJAVA-902
