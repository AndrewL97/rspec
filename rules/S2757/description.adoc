The use of operators pairs ( ``++=+++``, ``++=-++`` or ``++=!++`` ) where the reversed, single operator was meant (``+++=++``, ``++-=++`` or ``++!=++``) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.


This rule raises an issue when ``++=+++``, ``++=-++``, or ``++=!++`` is used without any spacing between the two operators and when there is at least one whitespace character after.
