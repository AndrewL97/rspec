There's no valid reason to test ``++this++`` with ``++instanceof++``. The only plausible explanation for such a test is that you're executing code in a parent class conditionally based on the kind of child class ``++this++`` is. But code that's specific to a child class should be _in_ that child class, not in the parent.
