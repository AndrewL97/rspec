Fields, parameters and return values marked ``++@NotNull++``, ``++@NonNull++``, or ``++@Nonnull++`` are assumed to have non-null values and are not typically null-checked before use. Therefore setting one of these values to ``++null++``, or failing to set such a class field in a constructor, could cause ``++NullPointerException++``s at runtime.
