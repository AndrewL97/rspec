I don't think this is a very valuable rule [~ann.campbell.2]

We already have other rules (such as the one limiting the nesting of language constructs) which spot spaghetti code.

this is frustrating [~dinesh.bolkensteyn]. In February, I could have told you were this rule idea came from; I know I didn't pull it out of thin air. Today, I can only close the ticket.

Well [~ann.campbell.2] this rule actually comes from the plugin :) it is implemented with the legacy key ``++ReturnInLoop++``

does that mean you want to deprecate and remove the rule from the plugin [~dinesh.bolkensteyn]?

Not considered a valuable rule. Will be removed from single implementing plugin: PL/SQL.
