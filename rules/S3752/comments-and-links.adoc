I agree that not specifying a HTTP method should be a blocking issue but that shouldn't be the case if you explicitly specify that both GET and POST are supported. For example the OpenID-Connect /userinfo endpoint should support both GET and POST requests according to the spec.

----
@RequestMapping(value = "/oauth/userinfo", method = {GET, POST}, produces = APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
----
This will trigger with the message: "Consider narrowing this list of methods to one"

Thanks for the feedback. Could you raise  your concern on the https://community.sonarsource.com/c/bug/fp[Community Forum] instead of here, as it's easier that using JIRA's comments? Thx
