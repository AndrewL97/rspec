\[~samuel.mercier] the 'meat' of this rule is all in the title. I know this is futile, but I'd love to see the title reworded to be shorter, with the details moved into the description.

\[~nicolas.bontoux] I think the use of bitwise operators on ``++enum++`` values is useful only when the enum has been defined in a certain way:


``++enum flags (NONE=0, ONE=1, TWO=2, NEXT=4, MORE=8, ...);++``


If we can recognize such enums, I'm all for adding an exception.

A ``++[flags]++`` attribute for enums is something that exists for C#, but there is no such thing in {cpp}.
