\[~freddy.mallet] what do you think of the SQALE characteristic? I'm not sure what to pick for rules about making your API easier to use.

Hi @Ann, according to the description of this rule the code provided in the "Non-Compliant Code Example" will lead to a runtime error so I would associate this rule to the SQALE "Reliability " characteristic. But at the same time I'm not sure to fully understand this rule.

Thanks for weighing in [~freddy.mallet], but what we're looking at in the first line of the  Noncompliant example is the function declaration, and as-is, you cannot use trailing closure syntax to call it. (This code made my eyes cross, and [~elena.vilchik] had to talk to me like I was 6 when explaining it.)

So this really is just about making your API easier to use, & I'm afraid the exactly right SQALE category doesn't exist for it. :-/
