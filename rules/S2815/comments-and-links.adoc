\[~ann.campbell.2] in {cpp} compared to Java, notion of "null" exists in a bit different form(s) - see \http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/NULL

So actually wonder - whether we should use term (styled as code) "null", or "nullptr" or "0"? WDYT?

I've removed the code formatting on "null" but don't want to use 0 instead here because \"``++this++`` can never be 0" doesn't read as smoothly (i.e. takes a little more thought to understand IMO) than \"``++this++`` can never be null".

\[~ann.campbell.2] I changed title and message according to your last comment, added literal "nullptr" into description and did simplification of examples. Could you please check?
