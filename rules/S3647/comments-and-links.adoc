Error 27: Uncorrelated EXISTS-subqueries.If an EXISTS-subquery makes no reference to a tuple variable from theouter query, is is either globally true or globally false. This is a very unusualbehaviour. Actually, uncorrelated EXISTS-subqueries are simply missing joinconditions (possibly for anti-joins).


Not sure if we want to handle this here or in RSPEC-3651
