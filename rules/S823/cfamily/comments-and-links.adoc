\[~ann.campbell.2] what about templates in {cpp}?


Also while this is a serious issue, I wouldn't say that definition in header file is always "bug".

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] Do you mean class templates? Like structs, they can be declared in a header. From what I'm reading, they should be (and it's easy to argue that structs should be too). Are you asking for an explicit statement in the rule to that effect?


I tagged this bug because it can lead to bugs but I was also ambivalent. What, if anything, would you suggest?

\[~ann.campbell.2] I was talking about function templates like

{noformat}

template<typename T> void f(T s) {

    std::cout << s << '\n';

}

{noformat}

IMO from the description / example not clear whether this compliant or not. And after you mentioned classes and structs - same story, requires re-reading of description several times for understanding. Probably update of examples can heavily improve situation.


Regarding tags I would say "pitfall".
