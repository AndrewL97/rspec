This rule seems ok to me but the message is not convincing me. I would go for something more explicit about the fact that the return value of the method is ignored.

"Return value of method 'xxx' is not used"

And we should be careful to not mix this rule with RSPEC-899:

* RSPEC-899 is about ignoring the result of a function call when this result indicates the status of the operation: KO, OK (so when exceptions are not used to trigger issues)
* This one RSPEC-2201, is about ignoring the result of a function call when this result contains the output of the operation

Per discussion, I floated closing RSPEC-899 to C-Family team & met with objections.

Hi [~ann.campbell.2], I don't understand why this rule is not part of "Sonar way" quality profile because for sure when an issue is raised this is bug.

As I recall [~freddy.mallet], it's a question of confidence in accurately identifying methods without side effects.

I know [~ann.campbell.2], but for instance in Java we've tuned the rule to be sure at 100% that we're not generating any false-positives (by limiting the scope to calls to immutable objects) and I think we must do the same thing for the other targeted languages. So at least in Java, this rule must be activated by default (cc [~nicolas.peru]).

I created https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarJS/issues/1948[a new issue on the SonarJS GitHub tracker] but I'm not sure if the fault is in the rule itself or in the JS/TS implementation of the rule, so I thought it might be worth bringing up here.
