First, thanks for finding the {cpp} analog. I'm guessing it was the difference between "Bit fields" +(C)+ and "Bit-fields" ({cpp}) which kept me from finding it when I looked.


Second, MISRA {cpp}:2008, 9-6-2 broadens the scope to include ``++bool++`` as acceptable. Since C has no ``++bool++`` type, how would you like to proceed? Define an exception?

Note to myself:


in {cpp}11 6.9p3:

____
It is implementation-defined whether a plain (neither explicitly signed nor unsigned) char, short, int, long, or long long bit-field is signed or unsigned.

____
whereas in working draft N4140 of {cpp}14 there is no such statement and in section C.1.8:

____
Change++:++ Bit-fields of type plain int are signed.

Rationale++:++ Leaving the choice of signedness to implementations could lead to inconsistent definitions of template specializations. For consistency, the implementation freedom was eliminated for non-dependent types, too.

Effect on original feature: The choise is implementation-defined in C, but not so in {cpp}.

Difficulty of converting: Syntactic transformation.

How widely used: Seldom.

Note that description was tuned for C (CPP-638), but must be tuned for {cpp} at a time of implementation.
