Marking a method with the ``++Pure++`` attribute specifies that the method doesn't make any visible changes; thus, the method should return a result, otherwise the call to the method should be equal to no-operation. So ``++Pure++`` on a ``++void++`` method is either a mistake, or the method doesn't do any meaningful task.
