\[~ann.campbell.2] I don't like the following thing: for AMD (``++define++`` function) we will raise one issue per module (aka file). While for CommonJS (``++require++`` function) will raise one issue per imported module. I like second approach and suggest to raise one issue per imported module for AMD too (i.e. per element in first argument array). Then we can change the message to ``++Use a standard "import" statement to import module "XXX".++``.
