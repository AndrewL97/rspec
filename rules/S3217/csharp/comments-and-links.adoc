\[~tamas.vajk] as I was writing this it occurred to me that someone might write this code thinking they were filtering the array (or whatever was being ``++foreach++``ed) so that the inner code would only be called for instances of the derived type. 


Am I correct in thinking that we can/should recommend LINQ usage to accomplish that?

\[~ann.campbell.2] Yes, you are right. If the dev wants to filter the list by type, the ``++arr.OfType<Raspberry>()++`` should be used in the ``++foreach++``.

Eric Lippert says he implemented this rule on the C# compiler, but then removed it because of the huge amount of false positives in Microsoft's own C# code, so this should be "MAJOR" and "suspicious" at most.
