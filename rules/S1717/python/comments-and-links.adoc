Deprecating this rule.

It raises many issues and most of them look like False Positives. The most common false positives are strings  containing regular expressions. Example:

----
import re
re.sub('\(', '[', '(test)')  # False Positive
----
This rule raises 380+ issues just on Pypy.


We could try to reduce the number of false positives by focusing only on strings passed to functions which do not use backslashes, such as ``++print++`` or ``++Exception++``, but the value seems to be low. The worst that could happen is that the backslash is displayed as part of the string or that a few characters are misinterpreted:
