We need to know:


1) All possible logger objects: LOGGER, Logger, logger


2) All possible logging methods: log(), warn(), warning(), error(), info(), debug()


There should be at least one logging method in the block having BOTH the exception as an argument + some other argument.

Conditions to log an issue :

* Either : The original exception is not used inside the try-catch block as a method parameter
* Or : When the original exception is used, the method call have only one parameter -> this original exception

I guess this will end up being too strong.


You can't do stuff like:


----
catch (IOException e) {
  throw Throwables.propagate(e);
}
----

In fact we couldn't even do stuff like:


----
catch (RuntimeException e) {
  throw e;
} catch (Exception e) {
  /* ... */
}
----

This is now fixed.


Guava's use case is still not allowed for the time being.

\[~ann.campbell.2] I'm wondering how and why this references Cppcheck "exceptRethrowCopy" ?

\[~evgeny.mandrikov] the message for exceptRethrowCopy is "Throwing a copy of the caught exception instead of rethrowing the original exception. (since Cppcheck 1.52)" 


If you're throwing a copy, you're not preserving the original.

\[~ann.campbell.2] To be precise - Cppcheck rule "exceptRethrowCopy" detects following case:

{noformat}

catch (Exception &e) {

  throw e; // use of copy-constructor, use "throw;" to avoid call of copy-constructor

}

{noformat}

Looking on current examples, I'm wondering why you consider exact-copy as not preservation of original.

Also IMO motivation behind Cppcheck rule is different than description of this RSPEC. Note that {cpp} has no built-in notion of stack trace, compared to Java.

If java code is something like this, this violation is showing up which is false positive


throw (cause instanceof RuntimeException ?(RuntimeException)cause:

			new XXXSystemException( cause, cause.getMessage(), e.getErrorCode()) ); 


I think this rule is not able to look into the throw params with ternary operator.
