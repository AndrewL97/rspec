\[~ann.campbell.2] and [~nicolas.peru], for a first implementation, I would do the following things :

* Search for all literals containing "password=xxxx"
* Search for all local variable whose names contains 'password' and which are initialized with a hardcoded literal.

I've removed the tag "owasp-top10", as this vulnerability is no more part of OWASP Top 10 2013 in MITRE CWE referential

For posterity,  list of translated words was removed and replaced by customizable parameter, because this was raising too many false postives.

\[~freddy.mallet] why do you think that semantic analysis is required? Current implementations (at least in SonarJava, SonarTS, SonarGo) rely only on AST, checking literal value or identifier name.

You're right [~tibor.blenessy] according to the current functional scope of this rule. I've updated the 'Analysis Level' field. Thanks

\[~tolun.ardahanli] the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/extend/adding-coding-rules/#header-4[rule writing guide] says titles should be plural when possible. (Call me if you want the English language reasons.)  If there's a reason to make this one singular, then it now needs an article.

Hi [~pierre-loup.tristant], 


Have you considered usage of term URI instead of URL? URI seems more generic to me and RFC 3986 defines URI and userInfo part of it. So I think URI should be prefered here.

\[~pavel.mikula] I agree with you it should be URI instead or URL. You can go for "Review this hard-coded URI, which may contain a credential." as the new issue message.
