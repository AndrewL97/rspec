\[~ann.campbell.2] What should we check here? Should we look for look for a more or less hardcoded password used in a database connection? I think that for other languages, we took a different approach: we look for variables which name contains "password" and which are assigned a hardcoded value.

\[~pierre-yves.nicolas] check out the Java code samples (RSPEC-2069), they parallel these quite closely. I.e. hard-coded strings used in the "password" position in a connection

\[~ann.campbell.2] OK, but I think that the current implementation of the Java rule would not catch the case mentioned in the example if the variable name was "pwd" instead of "password".
